### Training Data

* Data dictionary: 

| Name | Modeling Role | Measurement Level| Description|
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
|**ID**| ID | int | unique row indentifier |
| **LIMIT_BAL** | input | float | amount of previously awarded credit |
| **SEX** | demographic information | int | 1 = male; 2 = female
| **RACE** | demographic information | int | 1 = hispanic; 2 = black; 3 = white; 4 = asian |
| **EDUCATION** | demographic information | int | 1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others |

| **AGE** | demographic information | int | age in years |
| **PAY_0, PAY_2 - PAY_6** | inputs | int | history of past payment; PAY_0 = the repayment status in September, 2005; PAY_2 = the repayment status in August, 2005; ...; PAY_6 = the repayment status in April, 2005. The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; ...; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above |
| **BILL_AMT1 - BILL_AMT6** | inputs | float | amount of bill statement; BILL_AMNT1 = amount of bill statement in September, 2005; BILL_AMT2 = amount of bill statement in August, 2005; ...; BILL_AMT6 = amount of bill statement in April, 2005 |
| **PAY_AMT1 - PAY_AMT6** | inputs | float | amount of previous payment; PAY_AMT1 = amount paid in September, 2005; PAY_AMT2 = amount paid in August, 2005; ...; PAY_AMT6 = amount paid in April, 2005 |
| **DELINQ_NEXT**| target | int | whether a customer's next payment is delinquent (late), 1 = late; 0 = on-time |

### Quantitative Analysis

#### Area Under the Curve (AUC)

| Metric | Training | Validation | Test |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- | ---- |
| AUC | 0.783722 | 0.749610 | 0.7438 |

#### Adverse Impact Ratio (AIR)

| Protective Groups | AIR |
| ----------------- | --- |
| Hispanic-to-White | 0.83 |
| Black-to-White | 0.85 |
| Asian-to-White | 1.00 |
| Female-to-Male | 1.02 |

#### Correlation Heatmap
![Correlation Heatmap](https://github.com/tariaherbert/dnsc-6301-project/blob/main/correlation%20heatmap.png)
* **The correlation heatmap demonstrates the strength of relationships between variables. This heatmap displays a strong negative correlation between race and delinquency. This implies that customers of certain race groups may encounter less positive outcomes compared to other customers.**

### Ethical Considerations
* **Potential negative impacts of using this model**:
   * The final model is at depth 6 because there is a balance between the area under  the curve (AUC) and adverse impact ratio (AIR). This model has good fairness and performance. This model violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination against race, color, and national origin. Since the model contains demographic information to decide whether a customerâ€™s next payment is delinquent. This is disparate impact because the model will disproportionately impact protected groups. The final model has uncertainties although the outcome has improved because the adverse impact ratio (AIR) is barely above the accepted threshold of 0.80 for the hispanics and blacks. Also, the model associates numbers to the different protected groups, which unintentionally causes the model to rank and order the different type of customers within the protected groups.
